# 👋 Hi, I'm Raihan Kabir Ratul

I'm an AI Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems with AI. Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently:

---

### 🎯 [Vision-Language Model Case Study](https://github.com/ratulKabir/VLM_case_study)
A study on using vision-language models for understanding traffic scenarios in autonomous driving. This project explores direction prediction from multimodal inputs.

**Result:**

### 🚗 [Reinforcement Learning in CARLA](https://github.com/ratulKabir/carla_rl/tree/folder_refactor)
Trained an RL agent in CARLA simulator to navigate realistic driving environments. Focused on behavior learning from traffic scenarios.

**Result:**

### 🔍 [Natural Language to SQL](https://github.com/ratulKabir/natural_languge2SQL)
Built a pipeline that translates natural language questions into SQL queries. Useful for making databases accessible to non-technical users.

**Result:**

### 📦 [Custom Object Detection with Darkflow](https://github.com/ratulKabir/Custom-Object-Detection-using-Darkflow)
Trained a YOLOv2 model using Darkflow for detecting custom objects in video streams. Great for rapid prototyping of object detection systems.

**Result:**
